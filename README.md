# Typescript Game Engine

This project is a component-based game engine framework that includes a _nodejs_ server and a client-side library.
The goal is to allow developers to quickly bootstrap a game, avoiding boilerplate code that is common to many game
systems.

Everything is written in Typescript, in order to allow static typing checks that may be useful when working on large
projects, will still taking advantage of the flexibility of Javascript and of the community involvement on _nodejs_
packages.

As of now, this is only a work-in-progress, so be patient and this may someday become a fully-featured game engine!
